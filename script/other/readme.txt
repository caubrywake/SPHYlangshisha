compare_Qobs_sim.R
reads .tss files of discharge and makes plot to compare to observed discharge

average_spatial_runoff_REF.r
multi-year average of runoff maps

figs_flow_duration_curves_fut.r
figures with flow duration curves

figs_hydrographs_averagedyear_ref.r
average daily discharge output to average monthly over multiple years and plot

figs_waterbalance_calivali.r
calculate and plot water balance components for output locations

flow_longseries.r
plot a long timeseries of flows

pcraster2netcdf.r
convert pcraster output maps to netcdf files if you prefer doing postprocessing with netcdf files

/calibration
Example of a simple setup to do multiple runs with different parameter combinations (in this case it was used for calibration of degree day factors using geodetic mass balance data)
